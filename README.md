## Code Overview

The program uses a `Scanner` to read user input from the console. Based on the user's menu selection, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and displays the result.

## Error Handling

- If the user selects an invalid operation (not 1â€“4), the program prints **"Invalid Input"**.
- If the user attempts to divide by zero, it prints **"Error: Division by 0 is not allowed"**.
